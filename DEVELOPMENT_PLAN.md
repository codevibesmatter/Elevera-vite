## Questions for Discussion
1. Do we need additional OAuth providers beyond Google and Microsoft?
2. Should we implement team-specific file storage quotas?
3. Do we need audit logging for team/project actions?
4. Should we add real-time collaboration features?
5. Do we need to integrate any external services (Slack, etc.)?
