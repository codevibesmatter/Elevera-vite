# TanStack Router Developer Cheat Sheet

## 1. Route Configuration
- **Nested Route Trees**: Use a nested route tree to align the URL structure with the component hierarchy, enhancing clarity and maintainability.  
- **File-Based Routing**: Adopt file-based routing to streamline route management. Ensure your file naming conventions are consistent and align with your routing structure.

## 2. Layouts and UI Structure
- **Shared Layouts**: Implement shared layouts (e.g., headers and footers) using layout routes to avoid code duplication and maintain a consistent UI across different routes.

## 3. Data Loading and Fetching
- **Loaders for Page Data**: Use loaders to fetch data required by entire pages, allowing the router to handle loading states and errors, which simplifies component logic.
- **Component-Specific Data**: For data needed by individual components, utilize suspense queries to keep data scoped to the component, enabling the router to manage coordination effectively.

## 4. Authentication and Protected Routes
- **Protected Routes**: Create protected routes by wrapping them with authentication checks, redirecting unauthenticated users to login pages as necessary.
- **Redirect After Login**: After successful authentication, redirect users back to the page they initially attempted to access to enhance user experience.

## 5. Type Safety
- **Type-Safe Routing**: Leverage TypeScript to define routes, actions, and loaders, ensuring type safety and reducing runtime errors.

## 6. Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting to load only the necessary components for each route, improving application performance.
- **Preloading**: Use preloading strategies to load data or components in advance, enhancing perceived performance and user experience.

## 7. Error Handling
- **Error Boundaries**: Incorporate error boundaries to gracefully handle errors in your application, providing fallback UI and preventing crashes.

## 8. Navigation and Links
- **Custom Link Components**: Create custom link components to manage navigation, ensuring consistency and flexibility across your application.
- **Scroll Restoration**: Implement scroll restoration to maintain or reset scroll positions during navigation, enhancing user experience.

By adhering to these best practices, you can effectively utilize TanStack Router to build robust, maintainable, and user-friendly React applications.
